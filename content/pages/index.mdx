<DearName />

I'm starting a slightly different type of business. It's called GeneroUS.

The challenge is to build a business based on generosity.

Crazy? Maybe. I'll try to explain it here...

## Big picture

I read [this
article](http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2017/02/money-blockchains-and-social-scalability.html)
about Bitcoin. In essence, it says that what's really interesting about
Bitcoin is not the currency part, but the way that people work together. In a
way, Bitcoin is a bit like asking "could we use a model like Airbnb or Uber
to run a currency, without a company at the centre?" Hundreds, thousands,
maybe tens of thousands of people work on, around, or with Bitcoin. But
there's no meetings, no votes, no corporate hierarchy.

This started me down a path of thinking, how far could we take this concept?
My answer, all the way. I believe, it is theoretically possible, to build
networks like Airbnb or Uber without a company at their core. I believe that
if we succeed in doing this, we can create entirely new ways of trading based
on more than just price.

## How?

I had this idea at Burning Man in 2018. The question I spent the last year
contemplating, is how do we build this software? How to combine the approach
of profit driven, high growth startups with a focus on doing something for
the common good?

I think the Steward Ownership legal model is a good answer to this question.
It's a hybrid between for-profit companies, and staying focused on a mission.
You can read about the model in detail here. Simple summary, there's a fixed
maximum amount that investors and founders can be paid by the company, and
after that the company owns itself, and serves its mission. From that point
onwards, all profits are reinvested or donated to charity.

## Values

To build these kinds of networks, I believe we need certain values at the
core of the software. Or as Ksenya says, "all software is political". There
are political ideas at the heart of all our software. Why was the Cambridge
Analytica / Facebook scandal possible? Because we all trusted Facebook to
handle our data well. Turns out that was a bad idea.

## Business model

If we build systems where users have total control over their own data, total
sovereignty, how do we charge them? If they have total control, we can't
force them to pay. That's where generosity comes in.

My bet is that if we give people awesome software that helps them in some
meaningful way, they will choose to be generous in supporting our work.

## Crazy?

First question, am I crazy? Seriously, tell me what you really think!

<Question>
<Yes>
OK. Thanks for the feedback.

Seriously, honest feedback is valuable. Thanks.
</Yes>
<No>
Great. Thanks for the feedback.

Then the next question is, would you like to support GeneroUS?
<Question>
<No>
Fair enough. At least you don't think I'm crazy! Thanks for being honest.
</No>
<Yes>
Nice. Thank you. It really means something to me that you're up for
supporting the mission.

Right now, I'm looking for 5 - 10 people who know me to invest â‚¬20k into the
company. So far there are XXXX people committed. Would you like to talk about
the possibility of joining them?
<Question>
<No>
No worries. If you can think of anybody that we both know, who might be
interested, please let me know.
</No>
<Yes>
Awesome. I'll get in touch to set up a time.

Just to be clear, no pressure at all. If you think this sounds like a
worthwhile idea, and you're interested in exploring the potential to make an
investment, that's awesome. But if you're saying yes out of a sense of
obligation, no need.

So just to double check, are you really sure you want to have a chat about
it?
<Question>
<No>
OK. Thanks for being honest. I appreciate it.
</No>
<Yes>
Great. I'll be in touch.
</Yes>
