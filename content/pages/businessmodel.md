These values raise a key challenge. How to earn profit while
building open, peer to peer software? Our approach is generosity. We
believe people will crowdfund our software, and will choose to tip
us for software they love.

The unit economics of p2p are truly zero marginal cost. By focusing
on mass market software, we believe that generosity can be a viable
model.

We are a [Purpose](https://purpose-economy.org/en/) (or

company.
