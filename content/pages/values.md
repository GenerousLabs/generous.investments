Our company and our software is imbued with a set of values. We seek to balance profit incentives with restraint and a focus on the common good. These values are:

- Sovereignty
  - Rhizomatic
- Cooperation
  - Win win games
- Privacy
  - Transparency
  - Censorship resistance

## Sovereignty

The paradigm of most software companies is "give us your data, we'll take care of it". This is the fundamental paradigm. It's the underlying reason why the EU created the [GDPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation) and what enables events like the [Facebook / Cambridge Analytica scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebookâ€“Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal).

We believe in a different paradigm, where people retain sovereignty over their own data. We believe people can be trusted to decide with whom to share their data, when, and under what conditions.

This is what sovereignty means to us. People making informed decisions about what to do with their data, without trusting us, or any other company, to "take care of it".

### Rhizomatic

What is a rhizome? We've written an [article trying to explain the concept of a rhizome](/rhizome). It's quite abstract and theoretical, so bear with us if the article is not as simple as it could be. Suggestions on how to improve it are most welcome.

In short, we believe that rhizomatic networks scale better than hierarchical ones. Facebook as a prime example.

## Cooperation

Flexible cooperation at scale is what sets humans apart from other species. It's the single advantage that allows us to exert more control than any other species on the planet.

In school we are taught that cooperation is cheating. Each student must complete tests alone. We believe cooperation, and growing our skills, mechanisms, and habits of cooperation is crucial for the future viability of human society.

### Win Win Games

[Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://civilizationemerging.com/) writes about the [generator functions of existential risk](https://civilizationemerging.com/solving-the-generator-functions-of-existential-risk/). He argues that all existential risks are created by two underlying causes:

* Win lose games
* Open loop complex systems

His [article](https://civilizationemerging.com/solving-the-generator-functions-of-existential-risk/) and [this podcast](https://futurethinkers.org/daniel-schmachtenberger-generator-functions/) explain these concepts in more depth. In summary, if humanity is to thrive for the next century, we need to move past win-lose games and into win-win games.

This is a core value. The Generous Company is an experiment in win-win games. Cooperation is one of our core values.

We believe that digital goods, and more fundamentally, are multiplied and increase when shared. We therefore wish to share these resources as widely and freely as possible.

## Privacy
