Generous seeks to accept investments. In line with our
[steward ownership](https://medium.com/bettersharing/steward-ownership-is-capitalism-2-0-76a1c50a6d88)
model. Inspired by [slicing pie](https://slicingpie.com).

Investments can take the form of human time or cash. Human time earns a 2x multiple and cash earns a 4x multiple. Investments are grouped into rounds. We pay out earlier rounds first. In the first round we're taking a maximum of 10 â‚¬20k investments with a max 4x return.

We'll use a cryptographically signed ledger to track investments. We're also committed to financial transparency.
